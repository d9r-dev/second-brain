Title: Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking
Genre: Cooking

Iodized salt tastes metallic and has additives. Nowadays, we get our iodine from natural sources, making it essentially unnecessary. It’s better to use sea salt or kosher salt.

Salt enhances flavors. Add salt until the flavor unfolds (“zing!”). Salt counteracts bitterness and enhances sweetness.

Use regular processed kosher or sea salt and fleur de sel, etc., for garnishing.

Salt vegetables 15 minutes before processing, and mushrooms only when they start to brown in the pan.

Salt legumes when cooking or soaking them.
