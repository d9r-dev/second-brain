## The difference between a path variable and a query parameter

Imagine you have a jar full of balls with different colors. Each of this balls represents a item in our database with an ID and a color. If you want to get all the balls with the same color you would use a query parameter. Think of the query parameter as a kind of filter. 

Example: `/balls?color=yellow`

But let's say you want to fetch a very specific ball out of the jar (your database). For a [[REST]]ful-API it is the best practice to use a path variable. 

Example: `/ball/{ballId}`
