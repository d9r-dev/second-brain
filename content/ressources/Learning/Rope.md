- In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming), a **rope**, or **cord**, is a [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) composed of smaller [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)) that is used to efficiently store and manipulate a very long string. For example, a [text editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editing) program may use a rope to represent the text being edited, so that operations such as insertion, deletion, and random access can be done efficiently.
- A rope is a type of [binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree) where each leaf (end node) holds a string and a length (also known as a "weight"), and each node further up the tree holds the sum of the lengths of all the leaves in its left [subtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtree). A node with two children thus divides the whole string into two parts: the left subtree stores the first part of the string, the right subtree stores the second part of the string, and a node's weight is the length of the first part.
- For rope operations, the strings stored in nodes are assumed to be constant [immutable objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object) in the typical nondestructive case, allowing for some [copy-on-write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write) behavior. Leaf nodes are usually implemented as [basic fixed-length strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)) with a [reference count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting) attached for deallocation when no longer needed, although other [garbage collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) methods can be used as well.
- Advantages:
	- Ropes enable much faster insertion and deletion of text than monolithic string arrays, on which operations have time complexity O(n).
	- Ropes do not require O(n) extra memory when operated upon (arrays need that for copying operations).
	- Ropes do not require large contiguous memory spaces.
	- If only nondestructive versions of operations are used, rope is a [persistent data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure). For the text editing program example, this leads to an easy support for multiple [undo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undo) levels.
- Disadvantages:
	- Greater overall space use when not being operated on, mainly to store parent nodes. There is a trade-off between how much of the total memory is such overhead and how long pieces of data are being processed as strings. The strings in example figures above are unrealistically short for modern architectures. The overhead is always O(n), but the constant can be made arbitrarily small.
	- Increase in time to manage the extra storage
	- Increased complexity of source code; greater risk of bugs
