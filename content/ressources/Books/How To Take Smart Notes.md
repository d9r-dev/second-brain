â€¢ There are a lot of books about writing --> Style etc. but also psychology. But mostly about long form writing  
â€¢ bad notes taking has no immediate negative feedback but then there is the blank page  
â€¢ Good productive writing starts with good note taking  
â€¢ Most books focus on planning and self-discipline, but discipline is depleteable and you cannot plan insight, planning makes you inflexible
â€¢ Slip-Box  
â€¢ Luhmann  
â€¢ Productivity is not the result of will power and and the ability of overcoming resistance but of smart environments
