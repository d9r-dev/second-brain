Scrum is a agile software development management framework. It breaks work down into short time-boxed iterations, called sprints. It defines a series of regular meetings (Daily Scrum, Planning, Review, Retrospective, Refinement), roles (Product Owner, Developers, Scrum master) and artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint backlog, Increment).
